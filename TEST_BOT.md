# Testing Your Discord Bot

## Quick Test

The bot is now running and connected to Discord! Here's how to test it:

### Step 1: Go to Discord

1. Open Discord (web, desktop app, or mobile)
2. Go to the server where you invited the bot
3. Or open a DM with "Yusuf Personal AI"

### Step 2: Send a Test Message

Try these commands in order:

**Basic Test:**
```
What can you help me with?
```

**Email Test (if you have Gmail set up):**
```
Search for emails from me
```

**General Test:**
```
Hello, are you working?
```

### Step 3: What to Expect

The bot should:
- Show a "typing" indicator while processing
- Respond with a message
- If it's working, you'll see the response appear

## Expected Behavior

✅ **Working correctly:**
- Bot shows typing indicator
- Bot responds with a message
- Response makes sense for your query

❌ **Not working:**
- No response at all
- Error messages in terminal
- Bot doesn't show typing indicator

## Troubleshooting

**If bot doesn't respond:**
1. Check the terminal - are there any error messages?
2. Make sure the bot is online (green indicator in Discord)
3. Try sending the message again
4. Check that you're in the right channel (if you set DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID)

**If you see errors in terminal:**
- Share the error message and I can help fix it

## Next Steps After Testing

Once basic functionality works, try:
- "Help me draft an email"
- "Search for files in my Drive"
- "Reply to the email from [someone]"

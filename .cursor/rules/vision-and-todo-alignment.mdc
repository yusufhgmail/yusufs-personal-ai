Always use the VISION.md and TODO.md documents as core context for understanding
what we are trying to build. When you receive instructions or tasks, 
ensure the requested changes are aligned with the vision.

- If anything seems misaligned or unclear, ask me for clarification before proceeding.
- Never edit VISION.md or TODO.md unless I have explicitly instructed you to do so, or before checking with me.

## Goal

  - [x] Find email from miguel
  - [ ] Download attachment

## Doing Queue

## Queue Next

- [ ] Sometimes the AI seems to get confused, as if the order of the messages are wrong somehow: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DAy4M6pTscSA7VK8-whMSPkpKENH0S5S/view?usp=drivesdk, https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AqOqSfG3AL-5hXapX7HGIgBTDb2JoK3T/view?usp=drivesdk, https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XVYlXGW7XQ3XWexUeIETqXLDruWTMPWR/view?usp=drivesdk

## Notes

2026-01-07 I was able to browse folders, find the email address of miguel, search for emails, find the email. But failed when asked to download file. See scr: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qyqRgNurYGgX3718NiS7-dWtbD972sE7/view?usp=drivesdk. Also not sure if the "learning" works, so when it edits my doc, if it actually learns about me and puts learnings into it's memory. I'll fix the doc download first, then the learnings.
